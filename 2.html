You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

<br>Everyone else in the room can see it
<br>Everyone else but you

<p>Baby you light up my world like nobody else
<br>The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
<br>But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
<br>You don't know, oh oh
<br>You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful</p>

<p>So come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy</p>
